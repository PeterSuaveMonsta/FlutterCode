1Flutter Framework Usage: The code demonstrates the usage of the Flutter framework to create mobile applications. It includes features like UI components (e.g., Scaffold, AppBar, TextField, Image, ElevatedButton) and navigation (e.g., using Navigator).

2Widgets and Composition: The code utilizes various Flutter widgets and composes them to create complex UI layouts. For example, the Column widget is used to arrange child widgets vertically.

3Stateful Widget: The LoginPage is a stateful widget, indicating that it can maintain and update its state during the lifetime of the application.

4Navigation and Routing: The code demonstrates navigation between different pages (e.g., from login page to authorization page) using the Navigator and routing with MaterialPageRoute.

5Event Handling: Event handling is shown with the usage of onPressed property in buttons to perform actions when the buttons are pressed (e.g., navigating to another page, closing the application). The onPressed property is assigned a callback function to handle the events.
